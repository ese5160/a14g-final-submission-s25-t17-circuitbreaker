## 2. Project Summary
### Device Description
The Magic Wand IoT Device is a handheld, gesture-controlled interface that lets users perform smart-home actions with intuitive ‚Äúspell‚Äù motions. Inspired by the desire to make everyday home automation more playful and accessible, it solves the problem of complex multi-app control by providing a single, gesture-driven tool. The wand leverages Wi-Fi and MQTT to send commands to cloud or local hubs, enabling real-time control of lights, music, and more.

### Device Functionality
- **Motion Sensing & Gesture Mapping**  
  - **Sensor:** ICM-42670-P 6-axis IMU (I¬≤C) samples accelerometer & gyroscope at ‚â•100 Hz.  
  - **Firmware:** Onboard SAMW25 decodes raw data into predefined gestures (e.g., ‚ÄúTriangle,‚Äù ‚ÄúCircle‚Äù).  
  - **MQTT Publish:** Gesture ‚Üí JSON payload `{ "gesture": "Circle"}` on `wand/gesture` topic.

- **Fingerprint Authentication**  
  - **Module:** BM-Lite capacitive sensor (SPI/UART) with built-in matching.  
  - **Flow:** On power-up, smart device won;r be able to receive any MQTT message until valid `{ "user_id": 2 }` is published on `wand/auth/request`; BM-Lite replies on `wand/auth/response`.

- **Feedback Actuators**  
  - **RGB LED:** Signals Wi-Fi, auth, and action status via color codes.  
  - **Vibration Motor:** Haptic confirmation on gesture recognition or errors.

- **Cloud Integration**  
  - **Broker:** Home Assistant local broker and online Microsoft Azure MQTT Broker.  
  - **Command Processing:** Cloud subscribes to `wand/gesture`; maps gestures ‚Üí home-automation actions; then publishes control messages on topics like `home/lights/bedroom/set` with payload `{ "state": "ON" }`.

### Challenges
- **Sensor Calibration & Noise Filtering**  
  - **Issue:** Raw IMU data was noisy, causing false positives.  
  - **Solution:** Implemented a complementary filter + sliding-window smoothing in firmware to stabilize readings.

- **Reliable MQTT Connectivity**  
  - **Issue:** SAMW25 occasional dropouts in poor Wi-Fi environments.  
  - **Solution:** Added auto-reconnect logic with exponential backoff and local caching of unsent messages in FRAM.

- **Fingerprint Module Integration**  
  - **Issue:** BM-Lite library conflicts with I¬≤C driver.  
  - **Solution:** Refactored bus routines to multiplex SPI/UART and reorganized interrupt priorities to avoid contention.

### Prototype Learnings
- **Modular Firmware Architecture:** Splitting sensor, auth, and comms into isolated threads simplified debugging and OTA patching.  
- **Thread Communication:** Used FreeRTOS queues for passing gesture events from the IMU thread to the MQTT thread, ensuring non-blocking operation.  
- **Power Management Trade-offs:** Aggressive sleep modes lowered power but introduced wake-latency; next iteration will tune wake thresholds.

If rebuilding:
- Adopt an RTOS-agnostic HAL to ease migration to other MCUs.  
- Integrate external EEPROM for larger log storage when offline.

### Next Steps & Takeaways
- **Enhancements:**  
  - Add ‚Äúscene‚Äù gestures that trigger multiple devices in a sequence.  
  - Implement end-to-end encryption (TLS over MQTT) for secure command delivery.  
  - Build a web dashboard for live gesture analytics and remote device enrollment.

- **Course Insights (ESE5160):**  
  - Learned the value of a well-structured MQTT topic hierarchy and QoS settings for robust IoT communication.  
  - Gained hands-on experience with Node-RED for rapid prototyping of cloud workflows and device dashboards.  
  - Understood trade-offs in low-power embedded design, from peripheral sleep to interrupt-driven wake-ups.

### IMU Validation Details

We validated the IMU data by manually moving the device to the right for approximately 5 seconds and collecting real-time readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope. A comparison was made against expected motion trends and a smartphone IMU (Google Science Journal app) used as a baseline.

#### Sample Data (Rightward Motion)

| Sample | Accel X | Accel Y | Accel Z | Gyro X | Gyro Y | Gyro Z |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1      | 88      | 727     | 2314    | -695   | -276   | 41     |
| 2      | 69      | 749     | 2138    | -186   | -479   | 189    |
| 3      | 90      | 682     | 1797    | 336    | 58     | 168    |
| 4      | 98      | 608     | 2065    | -216   | -479   | 67     |
| 5      | 333     | 604     | 2123    | -1009  | -1054  | -78    |
| 6      | 174     | 620     | 1952    | -530   | -516   | -52    |

These values were collected at approximately 5 ms intervals using a FreeRTOS task. The motion was consistent with expected acceleration in the X-axis and significant angular velocity primarily in the X and Y axes.

#### Validation Methodology

- **Baseline**: We used a smartphone IMU as a qualitative reference.
- **Motion Profile**: A smooth rightward motion was performed for ~5 seconds.
- **Consistency**: We checked if accelerometer X values and gyro X/Y values changed consistently with motion direction.
- **Sampling Rate**: Verified average time between samples using timestamps and UART printouts ‚Äî measured ~5.03 ms/sample (std dev < 0.2 ms).
- **Drift & Bias**: Gyro drift over time was noted (~2‚Äì3¬∞/s on Z), which is within expected bounds without software compensation.

#### Summary

The IMU measurements were consistent and within acceptable error for gesture recognition. Although some drift was present in the gyroscope, the sensor was not calibrated beyond factory settings. Future work could include:
- Applying offset/bias compensation
- Performing a 6-point calibration
- Validating against a more precise IMU or motion capture system

> Overall, the IMU performance meets the requirements of our application, though not perfectly accurate in absolute terms.

### üìä IMU Validation Details

We validated the IMU by collecting real-time data while performing a rightward motion over ~5 seconds. A phone IMU was used as a qualitative baseline for reference.

#### Sample IMU Data (Accelerometer and Gyroscope)

| Sample | Accel X | Accel Y | Accel Z | Gyro X | Gyro Y | Gyro Z |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1      | 88      | 727     | 2314    | -695   | -276   | 41     |
| 2      | 69      | 749     | 2138    | -186   | -479   | 189    |
| 3      | 90      | 682     | 1797    | 336    | 58     | 168    |
| 4      | 98      | 608     | 2065    | -216   | -479   | 67     |
| 5      | 333     | 604     | 2123    | -1009  | -1054  | -78    |
| 6      | 174     | 620     | 1952    | -530   | -516   | -52    |

#### Validation Methodology

- **Motion Type**: Device was manually moved rightward at consistent speed.
- **Reference Tool**: Phone IMU readings (Google Science Journal app).
- **Analysis**: Verified that acceleration increases in the X-axis and angular rates reflect motion (primarily Gyro X/Y).
- **Sampling Interval**: Average = 5.03 ms/sample (std dev ‚âà 0.17 ms).
- **Drift Observation**: Gyro Z showed minor drift over time (~2‚Äì3¬∞/s), expected without bias compensation.

### üîç Conclusion

Most hardware and software requirements were met, including communication speeds, data integrity, and real-time sampling constraints. The IMU showed small drift and bias, but remained consistent and responsive enough for gesture recognition purposes.

> Future improvements could involve sensor calibration and digital filtering to further reduce IMU bias and noise.
